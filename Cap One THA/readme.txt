This folder contains answers to the asked questions as a part of the Capital One take home assessment as well as jupyter notebooks used to solve the questions.


The user is suggested to read the Answers.pdf along with corresponding jupyter notebook to completely understand the code as well as the answers.


Answers.pdf -> contains answers to the asked question

Jupyter notebooks:

Data_EDA.ipynb -> Work done corresponding to question 1, 2 and 3
Data Modelling.ipynb -> Work done corresponding to question 4


Instructions For running the notebooks:
Each notebook can be run independently by CHANGING the DATA DIRECTORY path to the original dataset.
Both the notebooks are well documented with the code intent and are therefore self explanatory. 


Credits: Sklearn and Pandas documentation, StackOverFlow for code bugs and ofcourse Google search engine to lookup code syntax
