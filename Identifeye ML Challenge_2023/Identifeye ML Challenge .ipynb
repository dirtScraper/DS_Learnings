    "Thank you for spending time on this take-home! We are delighted that you are considering a machine learning role at Identifeye Health. In this exam, you will solve a problem with immediate relevance to us: developing a model for predicting the quality of captured fundus images\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Doctors rely heavily on good quality images to confidently diagnose diseases and conditions. Thus, it is important to evaluate the quality of a captured image, namely checking that it is artifact free, has the right color balance and the required anatomical features visible, and so on. When an image quality is evaluated to be insufficient, the patient will recapture it to increase the chances of having an image that the doctor is able to interpret reliably. This is one challenge to which we apply machine learning!\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundus imaging is a well-established retinal imaging technique. Diagnosis is done through the inspection of the optic disc, the macula, and blood vessels. In a good quality image, all these main retinal elements need to be clearly visible, depending on where the image is centered. Additionally, other quality parameters determine the overall usability of the image for interpretation such as illumination uniformity, blur, color balance, contrast, field definition and the presence of artifacts. Below, we show sample bad quality images with their labels in the title, as well as a set of good quality images.\n",

    "**Based on this use case, your assignment is to build a model to predict the quality label of an image.** You have been given images of good (label 0) and bad quality (label 1). We have structured the assignment so that you work with incremental components of the problem in a way that gets you to a more complete understanding. Please make sure to read the directions in each steps!\n",

    "\n",
    "* You **are not** expected, within the limited time frame, to solve this problem entirely and invent a new way of analyzing image quality. We understand that you have a busy life, and have thus capped the amount of time you can spend on this problem to 3 hours. So, don't prioritize just getting the best performing model for each step!\n",
    "* You **are** expected to communicate your overarching approach to the problem and the components we have laid out, with clear articulation of answers and presentation of supporting data (tables, plots, etc). So, do walk us through and explain how you used the available data to draw appropriate conclusions!\n",

    "2. Two csv files containing the image name and quality label\n",

    "    \n",
    "        - This file contains 300 image names and their quality labels. You will be using this subset in the first section of the assignment. Quality labels are good(0) and bad (1). The accuracy of the labels in this subset is confirmed by medically trained professionals. \n",
